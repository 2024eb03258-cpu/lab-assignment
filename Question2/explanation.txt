# Question 2: File and Directory Management - Explanations

## Overview
This question focuses on Linux file and directory management commands, demonstrating practical skills in organizing project-related files within a home directory.


### Task 1: Project Workspace Setup
Command: `mkdir ~/documents`

Explanation:
Created a directory named `documents` in the home directory using the `mkdir` command. The `~` represents the home directory path, making sure the directory is created in the correct location of the current working directory.

Observation:
The directory was successfully created, providing a dedicated workspace for project files.

---

### Task 2: File Creation
Command: `touch ~/documents/plan.txt`

Explanation:
Used the `touch` command to create an empty file named `plan.txt` inside the documents directory. The `touch` command is used to create new files or update timestamps of existing files.

Observation:
Created a blank project plan file ready for content addition.

---

### Task 3: Content Addition
Command:
echo "Project Alpha - Development Phase
Start Date: 01-01-2026
Deadline: 01-03-2026
Team: Nida, Mahreen, Samiha
Tasks:
1. Analysis required
2. System Design
3. Presentation" > plan.txt

Explanation:
Used the echo command with output redirection (>) to write project planning content into plan.txt. The multi-line text includes project details, timeline, team members, and task list.

Observation:
Successfully populated the plan file with structured project information, demonstrating file content manipulation.

Task 4: File Metadata Verification
Command: ls -l ~/documents/plan.txt

Output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 codespace codespace 165 Dec 30 12:30 /home/codespace/documents/plan.txt
Explanation:
The ls -l command displays detailed file information.

Observation:
Verified file ownership and permissions, confirming proper file creation.

Task 5: File Duplication
Command: cp ~/documents/plan.txt ~/documents/plan_copy.txt

Explanation:
Used the cp (copy) command to create a duplicate file named plan_copy.txt. This creates an independent copy of the original file with a separate inode and storage.

Observation:
Created a backup copy of the project plan, demonstrating file duplication for version control or backup purposes.

Task 6: Directory Renaming
Commands: 
cd ~
mv documents project_documents

Explanation:
First changed to the home directory using cd ~, then used the mv (move) command to rename documents to project_documents. The mv command serves dual purposes: moving files between locations and renaming files/directories.

Observation:
Successfully renamed the directory to better reflect its purpose, showing effective directory management.

Task 7: Archival Structure
Command: mkdir ~/project_documents/archive

Explanation:
Created a subdirectory named archive within project_documents using mkdir. This demonstrates hierarchical directory structure creation for organized file storage.

Observation:
Established an archive directory for storing old or backup files, implementing good file organization practices.

Task 8: File Organization
Command: mv ~/project_documents/plan_copy.txt ~/project_documents/archive/

Explanation:
Moved the backup file plan_copy.txt from the main project directory to the archive subdirectory using mv. The trailing / in the destination path indicates it's a directory.

Observation:
Successfully organized files by moving the backup to the archive directory, demonstrating file categorization skills.

Task 9: Recursive Listing
Command: find ~/project_documents -type f -o -type d

Output:
/home/codespace/project_documents
/home/codespace/project_documents/plan.txt
/home/codespace/project_documents/archive
/home/codespace/project_documents/archive/plan_copy.txt

Explanation:
Used the find command with options:

-type f: Find files

-o: OR operator

-type d: Find directories
This displays the complete hierarchical structure of the project_documents directory.

Observation:
Successfully visualized the entire directory tree, confirming the organizational structure created in previous tasks.

Task 10: Path Verification
Command: realpath ~/project_documents/archive/plan_copy.txt

Output: /home/codespace/project_documents/archive/plan_copy.txt

Explanation:
Used the realpath command to display the absolute (full) path of the moved file. This command resolves all symbolic links and returns the absolute path.

Observation:
Confirmed the exact location of the archived file, verifying successful file movement and path accuracy.
